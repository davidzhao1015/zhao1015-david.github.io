We explored how vitamin D supplementation affects the gut health of 575 infants by analyzing their stool metabolites and gut bacteria. By combining health questionnaires with advanced lab techniques, we gained insights into how early nutrition influences a child's gut environment and overall well-being. [Learn More](about.md)

Knowing obesity risk earlier could help healthcare professionals manage children's weight more effectively. This project aims to use fecal microbiome data to predict future obesity risk with machine learning algorithms. Random Forest, XGBoost, GLMM, and Regularized Logistic classifiers were developed based on the data set of 2000+ infants. The optimal classifier achieved an AUC of 0.83 with a specificity of 73% and sensitivity of 85%.
